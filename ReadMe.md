## Description

This is a text-based Magic 8-Ball program that provides answers to your questions using ASCII art responses.
Gives an interactive way to seek answers to your questions.

The program features:

- Randomized responses for "Yes," "No," and "Non-Committal" answers.
- ASCII art that simulates animations for an appealing user experience.
- An option to exit the program using predefined exit phrases.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Visual Studio Code (or any code editor of your choice)
- Windows OS (for Windows-specific features)

## Customization

You can customize the program by modifying the responses or ASCII art. The responses are stored in 
separate header files.

- 'ASCIIYes.h' contains 7 "YES" responses.
- 'ASCIINo.h' contains 7 "NO" responses.
- 'ASCIIUnknown.h' contains 7 "NON-COMMITTAL" responses.

Feel free to replace the ASCII art with your own designs to create a unique experience.

To help, I used the following ASCII website generators for the ASCII art:

- ASCII Art Archive
- Super Emotes
- Patorjk
